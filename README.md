These files pertain to the Musical Acoustics coursework and are organized as follows: the source code 
is stored in the *"Code"* folder, the assignment files can be found in the *"Assignments"* folder, and the 
reports are located in the *"Reports"* folder. There are a total of 9 assignmentsï¼š
- **Helmholtz resonator and system impedance**
- **2D and 1D systems** (Circular membrane, Circular plate, Coupled system)
- **Horn design** (Design of the exponential section, Design of the compound horn)
- **Design of a piano** (Soundboard characterization, String pairing)
- **Design of a recorder** (Resonator, Flue channel)
- **Glass Harp** (Generate a 3D model of the Wineglass, Generate an axysimmetric model of the Wineglass)
- **Helmholtz Resonator tree** (Model the response of a single Helmholtz resonator, Combine more resonators in
  a tree and analyze the response obtained)
- **Piano string FD model** (Implement FD scheme, Generate the sound)
- **Brass instrument simulation** (Impendance of a tube, Tube with bell, Mouthpiece, Complete model)
